# transformer-VIT-_object_detaction
In the past few years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of 
computer vision technology in many applications such as security, surveillance and machine learning. 
One of the applications that have seen significant growth in the past few years is object detection. 
Object detection is the process of detection process if detective objects such as
the face,  vehicles or pedestrians in an image and video frame and then labelling each detected object. 
Vision transformers are a new invention that is introduced in deep learning for computer vision for object detection.
In this project, I implemented a VIT model from scratch, built an aircraft detection, and reached more than 80% accuracy.
